# Vending Machine & Inventory Management

## Overview

This project is a simple Python application that simulates an inventory management system for a vending machine. It provides a user-friendly interface to display available items, manage inventory, and print them in a neatly formatted box-style output.

### Features
- **Vending Machine Menu**: Displays items in a vending machine with their corresponding prices.
- **Inventory Management**: Shows a detailed list of inventory items, including their names, prices, and quantities.
- **Custom Formatting**: The output is displayed in a box format without using string methods like `ljust` or `rjust`, ensuring a consistent appearance.

## Files

- `inventory_item.py`: Contains the `InventoryItem` class, which defines the structure and behavior of inventory items.
- `final_main.py`: Contains the main logic for the vending machine menu and inventory management, including the `management_menu` and `display_vending_menu` functions.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MAJIDKIUMBHAR/vending-machine.git
    cd your_repository_name
    ```

2. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python3 final_main.py
    ```

    This will display the inventory and vending machine menus, formatted in a box style.
